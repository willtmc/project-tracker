# WTM Project Tracker Enhancement Summary

## Project Overview
The WTM Project Tracker is a Python-based tool that helps track projects across different stages of a workflow, generates daily and weekly reports, and monitors task completion within projects.

## User's Project Management Workflow
1. **Active projects** are kept in the **WTM Projects** folder
2. **Projects waiting on dependencies** from others are moved to the **WTM Projects Waiting** folder and moved back weekly
3. **Completed projects** are moved to the **WTM Projects Archive** folder
4. **Future ideas** or non-active projects are stored in the **WTM Projects Someday** folder

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Daily Report
- Added tracking for projects completed by finishing all tasks
- Added tracking for projects completed by being moved to the archive folder
- Implemented waiting projects tracking
  - Projects newly moved to the waiting folder
  - Projects returned from the waiting folder to active projects
- Added a "Waiting Projects Status" section to the daily report
- Added a "Project Waiting Status Changes" section to track movements to/from waiting

### 2. Directory Structure Updates
- Added support for the test projects directory to allow for easier testing
- Updated the code to process files from all relevant directories:
  - WTM Projects (active projects)
  - WTM Projects Waiting (waiting projects)
  - WTM Projects Archive (completed projects)
  - WTM Projects Someday (future ideas)
  - Test projects directory (for testing)

### 3. Command-Line Interface Improvements
- Updated the command-line arguments for better clarity
- Added support for preview mode to test report generation without updating the database
- Fixed email functionality to work with the new command-line arguments

### 4. Database Structure Updates
- Added tracking for archived projects via the `archived_projects` set
- Added tracking for waiting projects via the `waiting_projects` set

## Code Changes Made

### Main Files Modified
1. **project-tracker.py**
   - Enhanced the `generate_daily_report` function to track projects moved to/from waiting and archive
   - Updated the directory constants to include all project folders
   - Modified the `main` function to process files from all directories
   - Added the `email_report` function for sending reports via email

2. **run-daily-report.sh**
   - Updated to use the new command-line arguments
   - Removed the email address parameter as it's now hardcoded in the Python script

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Someday Projects Tracking**
   - Add tracking for projects moved to/from the Someday folder
   - Show when project ideas are being activated or deferred

2. **Time-in-State Metrics**
   - Add tracking for how long projects spend in each state
   - Particularly useful for the waiting state to identify bottlenecks

### Medium Priority
3. **Weekly Waiting Report**
   - Create a specialized weekly report focused on waiting projects
   - Help with the weekly process of moving projects from waiting back to active

4. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Enhance the waiting projects section to include information about dependencies
   - Add a way to tag or note what each project is waiting on

### Lower Priority
5. **Project History**
   - Implement a history tracking feature showing the movement of projects between folders
   - Provide insights into project lifecycle patterns

6. **Completion Time Metrics**
   - Track how long projects take from creation to completion
   - Calculate average completion times for different types of projects

7. **Command-Line Flags**
   - Add options to customize which sections appear in the report
   - Allow focusing on specific aspects of project management when needed

## Testing
To test the enhancements:

1. **Test Project Completion Detection**
   - Create a test project with all tasks completed
   - Run the daily report to verify it's detected as completed

2. **Test Archive Completion Detection**
   - Move a project to the archive folder
   - Run the daily report to verify it's detected as completed by archiving

3. **Test Waiting Project Detection**
   - Move a project to the waiting folder
   - Run the daily report to verify it's detected as newly waiting

4. **Test Return from Waiting Detection**
   - Move a project from waiting back to active projects
   - Run the daily report to verify it's detected as returned from waiting

## Known Issues
- Email functionality may fail if a local mail server is not configured
- The preview mode doesn't update the database, so some state transitions won't be detected until a non-preview run is performed

## Next Steps
The next development session should focus on:

1. Gathering feedback on the enhanced daily report format
2. Implementing the Someday projects tracking
3. Adding time-in-state metrics to provide insights into project flow
4. Enhancing the weekly report to include similar project state transition information
